# HELP-NGO
This is a model project through which I wish to help the NGOs in their internet presence for free. You are welcome to collaborate and contribute.

The Site would have the following pages:

1.Homepage: This page would be the dashboard which would have our recent works, appreciations if any, requirements.
2.Our works: This page would host the list of works we have done so far.
3.Appreciations: This page would host the apprecaitions we might have recieved.
4.Need Help: Through this page the NGOs would be able to post their requirement through filling pre-designed form.
5.Members: This would list the members who would be working.
